# DEA Registration Research Findings

## DEA Registration Requirements for New Applications

### Key Requirements:
1. **Personal/Business Information**: Full name, address, SSN, phone number
2. **Email Address Validation**: Must have access to provided email account
3. **Activity**: Business activity and drug schedule information
4. **State License(s)**: MANDATORY - Must provide VALID and ACTIVE state medical and/or controlled substance licenses
5. **Background Information**: Information about controlled substances in applicant's background
6. **Payment**: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover (fees non-refundable)
7. **Confirmation**: Electronic submission with confirmation

### Critical Points:
- **State licenses must be VALID and ACTIVE** - failure will cause application withdrawal WITHOUT refund
- For mid-level practitioners: includes supervisory agreements with specific authority for controlled substances if required by state
- Application fees are NOT refundable
- False information can result in up to 4 years imprisonment and $250,000 fine

### Forms Available:

- Form 363: Narcotic Treatment Programs
- Form 510: Domestic Chemical
- Form 224: Retail Pharmacy, Hospital/Clinic, Practitioner, Teaching Institution, or Mid-Level Practitioner (unavailable in PDF)

## Services That Previously Required DEA Registration:
1. **Suboxone prescribing** - Requires DEA registration + special waiver
2. **Controlled substance prescribing for psychiatry** - Requires DEA registration
3. **Testosterone replacement therapy** - May require DEA if using controlled substances
4. **Peptide therapy** - Depends on specific peptides used
5. **Medical weight loss** - May require DEA if using controlled appetite suppressants

## Next Steps for Research:
- Investigate which services can be provided WITHOUT DEA registration
- Research Pennsylvania state medical licensing requirements
- Analyze alternatives for each service type that don't require controlled substances



## Pennsylvania Medical Licensing Requirements

### Medical Physician and Surgeon (MD) Requirements:
- Passed a licensing examination acceptable to the Board
- Graduated from an accredited medical college or ECFMG certified international medical college
- Successfully completed graduate medical training
- **Practices the art and science of:**
  - Curing diseases
  - Preserving the health of man
  - **Healing arts, with or without drugs** ‚Üê KEY: Can practice without prescribing drugs

### Physician Assistant (PA-C) Scope:
**MAY Practice:**
- Medicine with physician supervision per written agreement
- Ordering, prescribing, dispensing and administration of drugs and medical devices
- Ordering, prescribing, and executing diagnostic and therapeutic medical regimens
- Any medical service within scope of practice and written agreement

**MAY NOT:**
- Provide medical services except as described in written agreement
- Practice independently
- Advertise as independent practitioner

### Key Insight:
Pennsylvania allows medical practice "with or without drugs" - meaning many medical services can be provided without DEA registration if they don't involve controlled substances.


## FDA Peptide Therapy Regulations (Updated February 2024)

### Key Points:
- **FDA banned 17 peptides from compounding pharmacies** (not a complete ban)
- **Peptides are NOT controlled substances** - no DEA registration required
- Well-studied peptides with generic forms are still allowed
- Compounding pharmacies can no longer compound certain peptides due to safety concerns

### Banned Peptides (from compounding pharmacies):
1. AOD-9604 (fat burning, muscle growth)
2. BPC-157 (healing, gut health) - still available as oral pill
3. CJC-1295 (growth hormone, longevity)
4. DIHEXA (brain health, cognitive function)
5. DSIP (sleep improvement)
6. Epitalon (anti-aging, telomere support) - still available as pill
7. GHK-Cu (copper peptides, skin health)
8. And 10 others...

### Important for Practice Recovery:
- **Peptide therapy can still be offered** using FDA-approved peptides
- **No DEA registration required** for peptide therapy
- Must use legitimate compounding pharmacies or approved peptide sources
- Focus on well-researched, FDA-approved peptides
- Some banned peptides still available in oral form

### Business Opportunity:
- Many peptide clinics affected by ban - market opportunity for compliant practices
- Can offer peptide therapy without DEA registration concerns
- Need to stay updated on FDA regulations and use approved sources
