>The AI chat widget is a powerful tool for instant patient communication, available 24/7 on our website. It can answer common questions, provide information about our services, and assist with consultation requests.

>### How the AI Chat Widget Works

>The chat widget appears as a blue chat button in the bottom-right corner of the website. Patients can click this button to open the chat interface and start a conversation. The AI assistant will greet them and ask how it can help. It can understand natural language and provide intelligent responses to a wide range of inquiries.

>- **Seamless Escalation:** While the AI handles most routine inquiries, it can be configured to escalate complex conversations to staff members when necessary.

>### Interacting with the AI Chat Widget

>As a staff member, you will primarily interact with the AI chat system through the admin dashboard, where you can view chat transcripts and take over conversations if needed. The system is designed to operate autonomously, but your oversight ensures a high standard of patient care.



>## 3. AI Receptionist

>Our new AI receptionist will handle all incoming calls to our practice phone number (484-357-1916), providing 24/7 availability and intelligent call routing. This system can answer patient questions, schedule consultation requests, and transfer calls to staff members when necessary.

>### How the AI Receptionist Works

>When a patient calls our practice, the AI receptionist will answer and greet them. It will first provide an emergency disclaimer, advising callers with urgent medical needs to hang up and dial 911. For non-emergency calls, the AI will ask how it can help and use advanced speech recognition to understand the caller's needs.

>### Key AI Receptionist Features:

>- **24/7 Call Answering:** Ensures that no patient call is ever missed, regardless of the time of day.
>- **Intelligent Call Routing:** The AI can answer common questions, provide information about our services, and route calls to the appropriate staff member when human assistance is required.
>- **Automated Consultation Requests:** The AI can collect patient information over the phone and automatically create a consultation request in our CRM system.
>- **Emergency Detection:** The system is trained to recognize emergency-related keywords and will immediately instruct the caller to dial 911.

>### Call Handling and Transfer Protocols

>- **Standard Inquiries:** The AI will handle most routine questions about our practice, services, and scheduling.
>- **Human Assistance:** If a caller asks a complex question, expresses frustration, or specifically requests to speak with a person, the AI will seamlessly transfer the call to a designated staff member.
>- **Call Logging:** All calls are logged in the admin dashboard, providing a complete history of patient communications.



>## 4. Admin Dashboard

>The admin dashboard is your central hub for managing patient information, viewing consultation requests, and monitoring our communication systems. Access to the dashboard is password-protected to ensure patient privacy and data security.

>### Accessing the Admin Dashboard

>To access the admin dashboard, click the "Admin" button in the website navigation bar. You will be prompted to enter your username and password.

>- **Username:** `admin`
>- **Password:** `LVW2024!`

>### Key Admin Dashboard Features:

>- **Patient Information Management:** View and manage patient records, including contact information, appointment history, and communication logs.
>- **Consultation Request Management:** Review and process all online and phone-based consultation requests. You can confirm appointments, schedule follow-ups, and update the status of each request.
>- **Chat and Call Logs:** Access complete transcripts of all AI chat conversations and phone calls. This allows you to review patient interactions and ensure a high standard of care.
>- **Reporting and Analytics:** The dashboard will provide valuable insights into our patient communication, including call volume, chat engagement, and consultation request trends.

>### Managing Consultation Requests

>When a new consultation request is submitted, it will appear in the admin dashboard. You will be able to view all the details provided by the patient, including their name, contact information, preferred service, and reason for visit. Your primary responsibility will be to:

>1. **Review the request:** Ensure all necessary information is present.
>2. **Contact the patient:** Reach out to the patient via their preferred contact method to confirm the appointment time and provide any additional instructions.
